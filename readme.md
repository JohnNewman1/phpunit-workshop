## Mettrr Phpunit Workshop

This is a short workshop to give people an introduction to the most common test scenario's they will face at Mettrr.

Install instruction:

- Fork the repository.
- Pull it down to your local.
- Run composer install.

To run Phpunit tests you will need to use this command:

` ./vendor/bin/phpunit`

To run one individual test you will need to add filter to that command like so:

` ./vendor/bin/phpunit --filter {the_test_name_here}`
